# Week-6-Assignment_Celebal-HyperParameter-Tuning
In this assignment, I trained multiple ML models using the Heart Disease CSV dataset to predict heart disease presence. I evaluated their performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

I also implemented GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to optimise model parameters and compared results to select the best-performing model.
The Best Performing Model was Logistic regression Model.
